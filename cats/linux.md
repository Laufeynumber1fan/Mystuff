About [drive partitioning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disk_partitioning#Unix-like_systems) in Linux.  
> A common minimal configuration for Linux systems is to use three partitions: one holding the system files mounted on "/" (the root directory), one holding user configuration files and data mounted on /home (home directory), and a swap partition.
  
> When a partition is deleted, its entry is removed from a table and the data is no longer accessible. The data remains on the disk until it is overwritten.
